description: What is go-bpmn?
---

go-bpmn is a process engine for executing and automating processes, modeled using the [Business Process Model and Notation](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/) (BPMN 2.0) standard.

## Design principals

The following principals explain why go-bpmn was built and how it is working.

### No BPMN extension

The execution of a process does not rely on BPMN extension elements - a mechanism to extend standard BPMN elements with additional, software-specific properties.
As a result, processes can be modeled, using any modeler that produces valid BPMN 2.0 XML.

### Job delegation

When an execution reaches a BPMN element that requires process-specific logic (e.g. an exclusive gateway, a service task or a timer event), the process engine delegates the work in form of a job.
A job is a unit of work, which must be locked, executed and completed by a worker - an application, system or user that automates a process.

Due to this design, process automation is completely independent of process modelling.
Moreover job delegation allows to execute any logic in any language, and to scale workers without affecting the process engine.

### PostgreSQL based

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) is the most popular database management system.
It is well understand and known for its reliability, performance and good documentation.

The process engine stores processes, execution state and data in a PostgreSQL database.
It makes use of choosen SQL features and concepts like table partitioning, row-level locking, skip locking, conflict actions or information duplication.
This ensures that information can be looked up efficiently, avoiding joins, and that a concurrent execution is guaranteed.
