```sh
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 go-bpmn /usr/local/bin/go-bpmn
```

```sh
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 go-bpmn-pgd /usr/local/bin/go-bpmn-pgd
```

:::note
If you do not have root access, make the files executable and move them to a directory, which is included in `$PATH`.

```sh
chmod +x go-bpmn
chmod +x go-bpmn-pgd

mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

mv ./go-bpmn ~/.local/bin/go-bpmn
mv ./go-bpmn-pgd ~/.local/bin/go-bpmn-pgd

# add ~/.local/bin to $PATH
```
