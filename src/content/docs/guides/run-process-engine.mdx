For running a process engine, only a connection to a PostgreSQL database is required. To configure a database connection, the environment variable `GO_BPMN_PG_DATABASE_URL` must be set - an example:

```sh
export GO_BPMN_PG_DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@127.0.0.1:5432/database?search_path=schema"
```

Connection string examples and connection pool variables can be found in the [pgxpool](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool@v5.7.4#ParseConfig) Go package documentation.

After PostgreSQL database connection is configured, the daemon can be started:

```sh
go-bpmn-pgd
```

## Configuration

A process engine daemon is configured via environment variables and/or environment variable files (so called `env` files).

Run following command to list all available configuration options:

```sh
go-bpmn-pgd -list-conf-opts
```

To display the current configuration, considering set environment variables and specified environment variable files, run following command:

```sh
go-bpmn-pgd -list-conf
```

:::tip[How to create a custom configuration?]
As a starting point, the daemon's default configuration can be used to create an `env` file.
:::

```sh
go-bpmn-pgd -list-conf > ~/go-bpmn-pgd.env

# edit ~/go-bpmn-pgd.env

go-bpmn-pgd -env-file ~/go-bpmn-pgd.env
```
