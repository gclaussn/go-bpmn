summary: Create process
description: >
  Creates a process that is modeled as BPMN XML.


  If a process with the same BPMN process ID and version exists, the BPMN XML is compared.
  When the BPMN XML equals, the existing process is returned.
  When the BPMN XML differs, a problem of type `CONFLICT` is returned.
